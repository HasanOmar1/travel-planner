# travel-planner

I have created a traveling agency with admin mode or normal user mode.

Created a login form with authentication.
Added the option to login as an Admin or as user.
Added localstorage to save the login info.

### Agency Features:

- Search by from / Search by to.
- Sort by price.
- Add ticket to cart.
- Booking feature.

### Admin has extra features such as :

- Add extra flights
- Update tickets price.

#### Bugs that are not finished yet :

- Localstorage all the flights instead the ones i bought.
- Adding a flight to cart then removing still counts towards the total price.
